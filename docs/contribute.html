      <div class="content">
        Every day hateful, insulting and threatening emails are sent to scientists around the world. The hatemail project aims to collect these messages and raise public awareness of the problem.
      </div>

      <h4 class="title is-4">Simply forward!</h4>
      <div class="content">
        Whenever you receive an insulting or threatening email, just forward to 
        <a class="is-family-monospace has-text-black" style="border:1px solid #dddddd; border-radius: 5px; padding:5px; background-color: #eeeeee;" href = "mailto: report@hatemail.cc">  
          report@hatemail.cc</a>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        Please make sure to forward from an academic institution email account. Your message should include both the content of the hatemail and the email address of the author. At the moment, only English and German hatemails can be considered.
      </div>

      <h4 class="title is-4">What data is stored and published?</h4>
      <div class="content">
        We store your emails in a secure place for the duration of the project. We further publish a dataset of all contributions. In this dataset, all personal information is removed or pseudonymized. In fact, we only publish the content of the hatemail, non de-identifying hash codes of your and the hatemail author's email address as well as the domain of your academic institution (e.g., <i>law.harvard.edu</i> when you write from an harvard law school email such as <i>john.doe@law.harvard.edu</i>).
      </div>

      <h4 class="title is-4">What do you do with the data?</h4>
      <div class="content">
        We use the hatemail content to raise awareness for messages insulting and threatening scientists. We further analyse the data to explore communication patterns and networks. As explained before, parts of the data are shared with the public.
        <br>
        Please note that your name or email address will never be published. We may rarely contact you via email to inform you about project updates, distribute research findings that were drawn from your data, or invite you to take a related survey. 
      </div>

      <h4 class="title is-4">Can I also contribute Tweets?</h4>
      <div class="content">
        We are also collecting insulting and threatening Tweets.<br>Simply share such messages with our Twitter account
